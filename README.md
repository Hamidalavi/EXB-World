# EXB-World
## How Ex Buddy (EXB) World Created? Listen to Examid's lectures to know about this amazing world!

There are many steps and Examid will update the path of evolution:

### Home Star
Stars are the power source of the universe. Solar waves pour onto nearby planets and provide energy for millions of years.

### Planet Earth
Earth provides just the right mixture chemicals, an abundance of water, and an oxygen-rich atmosphere, creating the ideal environment for developing life.

### Primordial Soup
On the primeval planet Earth, an atmospheric solution rich in organic compounds set the ideal conditions for the development of life.

### Moon
The gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun, and the rotation of Earth, turn the tides of the ancient oceans to advance life (unlocked: The moon is born when a Mars-sized object hits the young Earth).

### Amino Acid
Atoms and molecules bond together to create amino acids, organic compounds that combine to build proteins. They are some of the most essential building blocks for life (unlocked: Amino Acids are the building blocks of life).

### Nucleotides
Nucleotides are the chemical compounds that builds the foundation for DNA & RNA.
> DNA: A molecule with the unique property of self-replication, DNA's infinite configurations form the foundation of all evolutionary changes. It contains the genetic instructions for all life on Earth.
>> RNA: RNA is responsible for transferring genetic code from the nucleus to ribosomes to make proteins. It controls gene expression and regulation.
