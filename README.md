# EXB-World
## How Ex Buddy (EXB) World Created? Listen to Examid's lectures to know about this amazing world!

There are many steps and Examid will update the path of evolution:

### Home Star
Stars are the power source of the universe. Solar waves pour onto nearby planets and provide energy for millions of years.

### Planet Earth
Earth provides just the right mixture chemicals, an abundance of water, and an oxygen-rich atmosphere, creating the ideal environment for developing life.

### Primordial Soup
On the primeval planet Earth, an atmospheric solution rich in organic compounds set the ideal conditions for the development of life.

### Volcano
The carbon dioxide produced by erupting prehistoric volcanos warmed the Earth, and was a major catalyst in making Earth habitable in its early stages of development.
> Ozone Layer: The ozone layer in the Earth's stratosphere protects the planet from ultraviolet radiation. Over time, human pollution has damaged this essential barrier.

### Moon
The gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun, and the rotation of Earth, turn the tides of the ancient oceans to advance life (unlocked: The moon is born when a Mars-sized object hits the young Earth).

### Amino Acid
Atoms and molecules bond together to create amino acids, organic compounds that combine to build proteins. They are some of the most essential building blocks for life (unlocked: Amino Acids are the building blocks of life).

### Nucleotides
Nucleotides are the chemical compounds that builds the foundation for DNA & RNA.
> DNA: A molecule with the unique property of self-replication, DNA's infinite configurations form the foundation of all evolutionary changes. It contains the genetic instructions for all life on Earth.
>> RNA: RNA is responsible for transferring genetic code from the nucleus to ribosomes to make proteins. It controls gene expression and regulation.

### Protein
The building blocks of living cells, proteins are molecules made from long chains of amino acids.

### Prokaryotic
The first living organism. These tiny uni-cellular organisms lacked a membrane-wrapped nucleus, but paved the way for the rest of life to begin (unlocked: The first signs of life bubble up in the primordial soup).

### The Plasma Membrane
The plasma membrane protects the interior of cells from the environment.

### Bacterium
Bacteria are unicellular microorganisms that have cell walls, but none of the organelles that make up multicellular organisms. While some can make you sick, most bacteria are harmless and many are actually necessary for you to survive.

### Mitochondria
The powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria are organelles that converts glucose to energy.

### Nucleus
A cell's control center, the nucleus contains the chromosomes that house DNA.

### Virus
A virus is a biological agent that replicates within other cells. Surprisingly, if it were not for the virus' ability to infilitrate the DNA of organisms, humans might not even exist.

### Mitosis
Mitosis is a process of asexual reproduction where one cell divides into two identical cells. It occurs only in eukaryotic cells, and enables single-celled organisms to multiply.

### Asextual Reproduction
Similar to mitosis, asexual reproduction is the process by which an entire organism is produced from a single parent. Some types of asexual reproduction are budding, sporification, and parthenogenesis.
> Sextual Reproduction: A long method of cell multiplication involving both meiosis and mitosis. Sexual reproduction combines genetic information from two individuals of different types, or sexes, to create a new organism.

### Eukaryotic Cell
The prokaryotic cell's more complex cousin, eukaryotic cells have a nucleus to store genetic information. Fungi, plants, animals, and protozoa are all built of eukaryotic cells.

### Cytoplasm
Cytoplasm is a gel-like, colorless substance that fills the inside of a eukaryotic cell. It is secured by the cell membrane and all of the organelles float in it.

### Tissue
Tissues are groups of cells come Plas together to perform a specific function. Organs are formed by groups of tissues.

### Muscles
Muscles are fibrous tissue in an animal's body with the ability to contract. This action enables the muscles to move, in turn moving the bones that are attached to them.

### Filter Feeding
A passive way of finding nourishment involves having nutrients filter Plas through an organism's body. This is the feeding method of choice for shellfish, krill and sponges.

### Sponge
The world's first multi-cellular organism, sponges are stationary filter feeders. They are a product of multiple eukaryotic cells coming together (unlocked: The one becomes the many: the first multi-cellular organism emerges).

### Coral
Coral is a marine invertebrate with a hard calcium-carbonate exoskeleton. Colonies of corals that grow together can create reefs, diverse underwater ecosystems that provide a home for many sea creatures.

### Jellyfish
Jellyfish are softbodied, free-swimming aquatic animals with a gelatinous, umbrella-shaped body and long floating tentacles. They can propel themselves through water by pulsing their body (unlocked: Life leaves the ocean floor, and the journey begins).

### Nervous System
The nervous system is a network of cells that sends stimuli through an organism's body in the form of electrical impulses. It is controlled by a central brain.

### Swimming
The simple act of swimming gave many organisms the ability to move from one location to another for the first time.
